# Dockerized Education Platform
This is a dockerized version of the education platform for trying out the platform locally.

Further details on the platform can be found on the main [platform wiki page](https://github.com/mdenet/educationplatform/wiki).

Any bugs, feature requests, or suggestions can be added to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mdenet/educationplatform/issues).

## Prerequisites 
### Core
 1. [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
 2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 3. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### System
1. Disk space - 20 GB 
2. Memory - 3 GB

If using a linux based virtual machine, the minimum recommended settings of 3GB system memory and 30GB virtual disk should be used.

### Mac Preconfiguration
Docker on Mac defaults to 2GB of system memory which is not sufficient since Docker uses virtualisation to run containers on Mac. The minimum recommended value to use as the minimum Docker memory limit is 6GB. See the [Docker desktop documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/) for further details on how to configure this.

### Windows Preconfiguration
If using Windows to run the platform, a few additional steps are required.

- Enable long paths for git.
```
git config --global core.longpaths true
```

- If the mdenet/educationplatfom-docker repository has previously been checked out, you may have to clear submodule indexes so that file line endings re-normalised correctly.

```
git submodule foreach 'git rm --cached -r .'
``` 

- Ensure that the docker daemon is running by starting Docker Desktop from the start menu or by powershell command  
``` 
& "[DOCKER_INSTALL_PATH]\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe" 
```
where `DOCKER_INSTALL_PATH` is the path to install docker which  usually defaults to
`C:\Program Files\Docker`.


- Ensure that the docker is set to use the linux engine by right-clicking the Docker Desktop icon in the system tray menu and selecting use linux engine or by running the command 
```
[DOCKER_INSTALL_PATH]\Docker\DockerCli.exe -SwitchDaemon -SwitchLinuxEngine
```

## Checkout the repository
Use either command to clone the repository and all of its submodules.

**Via https -**
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mdenet/educationplatform-docker.git
```

**Via ssh -** 
```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:mdenet/educationplatform-docker.git
```

> Note that for ssh access you must [configure](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) your account with a key.

## Environment Variables

Before building the platform the ```env.example``` file should be renamed to ```.env``` and the environment variables listed below must be populated with relevant values listed below.

 + **TRUSTED_ORIGINS** comma delimited whitelist of base URLs (with no trailing slash) for CORS aware endpoints
 + **ES_DEPLOY_ADDRESS** base URL + /tools/xtext/editors
 + **ES_ADDRESS** base URL + /tools/xtext/project
 + **TOKEN_SERVER_URL** base URL of the token server
 + **WEBSOCKETS_URI** base URL + /tools/xtext/services/xtext/ws

Here is an example of the ```.env``` file provided that the base URl of the platform server is https://ep.mde-network.org:

```
TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://ep.mde-network.org
ES_DEPLOY_ADDRESS=https://ep.mde-network.org/tools/xtext/editors
ES_ADDRESS=https://ep.mde-network.org/tools/xtext/project
TOKEN_SERVER_URL=https://ep.mde-network.org/
WEBSOCKETS_URI=https://ep.mde-network.org/tools/xtext/services/xtext/ws
```

## Build and run the docker image
This builds the docker images and starts the platform servers.
```
cd ./educationplatform-docker

docker compose up --build 
```

> Note it may take approximately 10 minutes the first time the platform is built.


## Access the platform

Once docker has [started](#build-and-run-the-docker-image) the containers, the platform will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8080

**403 Error**

If a 403 forbidden permissions error is encountered, the permission of the files used in the docker volumes must be configured. For linux based system run the following command from the `educationplatform-docker` directory.

``` 
chmod -R 755 {public,educationplatform-examples} 
```


> Note - that browsers cache the platform pages so if changes are made to an activity or its files hard refresh should be used to reload the page by pressing `ctrl+F5` or `cmd+shift+R`. 

## Stopping the platform

To safely stop the platform use `ctrl-c`  in the terminal running the platform.


## Deployment on a Server Behind a Load Balancer

It is quite common to have a web server running behind a firewall or load balancer. In this scenario, the public IP of the server or the FQDN can only be accessed on either port 443 (HTTPS) or 80 (HTTP). Therefore, it is not possible to interact with containers that run on other ports of the server directly. To access the education platform and other containers, the reverse proxy container acts as a gateway and is pre-configured to listen on port 8080. The reverse proxy container can also be used when there is no load balancer.
